Description:This pipeline allows you to quickly find the gene family of interest to you. 
    Find information about relevant protein sequences and gene sequences from NCBI
    (National Center for Biotechnology Information). 
    It also provides physicochemical properties and evolutionary analysis of proteins 
    and the localization of genes on chromosomes. 
    Also provides input with other packages for further analysis of your interest.
